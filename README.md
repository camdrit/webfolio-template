# webfolio-template
A simple and clean web portfolio template made with jQuery and Materialize.
Works beautifully across all modern browsers, including IE.

# Demo
I use this design for my own portfolio! Check it out here: https://developedbycam.net

# Features
* Responsive design that adjusts based on window size (mostly thanks to Materialize!)
* Clean black and white layout that can be colorized with minimal CSS adjustments.
* Starter Open Graph tags for Social Media sites / link previews.
* Basic template style modals and contact buttons that build based on link attributes.

# Maintenance "Mode"
Adding the `construction` class to an interactive element will provide a toast notification that the component is under construction when clicked.

# Note Regarding Social Media Icons
The social media icons (Facebook, Github, and LinkedIn) are designed by Google but not baked into the Material Icons font due to legal limitations. They have been included manually and still fall under the original font's Apache License Version 2.0.
